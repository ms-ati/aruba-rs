# aruba-rs
Test **command-line** applications written in **Rust** using the
[Cucumber testing framework for Rust](https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber).

See also: the original [Aruba](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba), which while written in Ruby, can also be used to
test any command-line application. 

This project aims to make it _easy and painless_ to use Cucumber with _Rust CLI apps_.
