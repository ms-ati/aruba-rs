# aruba-rs

Supports executable specifications for command-line (**CLI**) applications
written in **Rust** using the
[Cucumber-rs](https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber) testing framework for Rust.

This project aims to make it _easy and painless_ to use Cucumber with Rust CLI apps!

## Relationship to Ruby Aruba

`aruba-rs` aims to be an increasingly complete
[port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting) of the original
[Aruba](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba) project from Ruby to Rust.

Just like the original Ruby-language project, `aruba-rs` aims to serve
two primary use cases - to create and maintain executable specs:
  1. Inside projects written in the same language (Rust)
  2. Outside existing CLI apps written in any language
